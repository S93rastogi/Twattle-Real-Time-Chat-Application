# Twattle-Real-Time-Chat-Application

Teleconferencing or Chatting, is a method of using technology to bring people and ideas “together” despite of the geographical barriers. The technology has been available for years but the acceptance it was quit recent. Our project is an example of a chat server. It is made up of 2 applications the client application, which runs on the user’s Pc and server application, which runs on any Pc on the network. To start chatting client should get connected to server where they can practice two kinds of chatting, public one (message is broadcasted to all connected users) and private one (between any 2 users only) and during the last one security measures were taken. User can send private message using pm command followed by username and message. If we toggle the speech synthesis and speech recognition to ON state the microphone starts recording. The google web speech api helps to convert the voice message to text and read the data aloud on the opposite user end. The emoji feature has been added to help make the chat interactive. It helps to express the mood of the user.
